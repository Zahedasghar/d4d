# 🧠 Workshop Overview

This 5-day workshop focuses entirely on learning how to use **AI prompts for data analysis**, regardless of whether the analysis is done in R, Python, Stata, SPSS, Excel, or Tableau.

The workshop emphasizes:

- Prompt engineering for data  
- Analysis roadmap prompts  
- EDA prompts  
- Survey & NHANES prompts  
- Modeling prompts  
- Mapping prompts  
- Storytelling prompts  
- Debugging prompts  
- Vibe-coding prompts  
- Case-based scenario prompts

# Day 1 — Foundations of AI Prompting for Data Analysis

## 1.1 What is a Data Prompt?
A data prompt guides AI to produce relevant, accurate, and structured analysis.

## 1.2 CRISP Prompting Method
**C — Context**  
**R — Role**  
**I — Input**  
**S — Steps**  
**P — Preferred Output**

### Template
```
You are a data analysis expert.
Context: [dataset]
Task: [goal]
Steps: [analysis steps]
Output: [tables, plots, bullet points]
```

## 1.3 Core Prompts for Day 1

### 🔍 Dataset Understanding
```
Provide structure, variable types, missingness, and 10 insights from this dataset.
```

### 📊 EDA Roadmap
```
Create a complete EDA plan with summaries, grouped analysis, and recommended plots.
```

### 📁 Data Dictionary
```
Generate a data dictionary for all variables, including definitions and plausible ranges.
```

---

# Day 2 — Survey, Health, Demographic & NHANES Prompting

## 2.1 Survey Data Prompts
```
Summarize this survey dataset: sampling design, weights, PSUs, strata, key demographics.
```

## 2.2 NHANES Prompts

### Cleaning & Merging
```
Clean NHANES data: demographics, labs, exams. Create BMI category, BP groups, race labels.
```

### Risk Index
```
Create a composite risk index using hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking, inactivity.
```

### Survey-Weighted Model
```
Fit a weighted logistic regression predicting hypertension and interpret results simply.
```

---

# Day 3 — Modeling Prompts

## 3.1 Universal Model Selection
```
Choose the best model for this outcome. Compare regression, logistic, random forest, boosting, and explain decision.
```

## 3.2 Regression Interpretation
```
Fit a regression model and explain coefficients in simple English with policy insights.
```

## 3.3 Classification
```
Build a classification model. Provide confusion matrix, feature importance, and interpretation.
```

## 3.4 Time-Series
```
Analyze long-term trends, produce forecasts, and describe patterns.
```

## 3.5 Panel Data
```
Fit FE and RE models, run Hausman test, and interpret results for policymakers.
```

---

# Day 4 — Maps, Storytelling, Visualization Prompts

## 4.1 Mapping Prompts
```
Join spatial data with indicators and create a choropleth map. Explain spatial variation.
```

## 4.2 Visualization Enhancement
```
Improve this plot: labels, theme, color scheme, clarity, interpretability.
```

## 4.3 Storytelling Prompts

### Narrative Writing
```
Write a three-paragraph narrative explaining the findings in simple English.
```

### Executive Summary
```
Write a one-page executive summary with key findings, implications, and recommendations.
```

### LinkedIn Post
```
Convert this analysis into a concise, engaging LinkedIn post.
```

# Day 5 — Debugging, Vibe Coding, Scenario Practice

## 5.1 Debugging
```
Find the error in this analysis pipeline, explain the reason, and provide corrected code/output.
```

## 5.2 Vibe Coding
```
Rewrite my analysis code to be cleaner, more readable, modular, and commented.
```

## 5.3 End-to-End Project Prompt
```
Produce an entire analysis workflow:
cleaning → exploration → modeling → mapping → insights → narrative.
```
