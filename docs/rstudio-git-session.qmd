library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), 
             size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. Fuel Efficiency",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
```

# Scripts and Documents

## Two Ways to Write Code

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R Scripts (`.R`)

```r
# Pure code files
# Comments with #

library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("data.csv")

model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)

summary(model)
```

**Use for:**

- Data processing pipelines
- Function definitions
- Quick analyses
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Quarto Documents (`.qmd`)

````markdown
# My Analysis

Here's what I found:

```{{r}}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data.csv")
```

The results show...
````

**Use for:**

- Reports and papers
- Presentations
- Documented analyses
- Tutorials
:::
:::

## Why Quarto/RMarkdown?

**Reproducible Research Made Easy**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Code + Text in One Place**
   - No copy-paste errors
   - Analysis and writeup together

2. **Multiple Output Formats**
   - PDF (via LaTeX)
   - HTML (with interactive elements)
   - Word (for collaboration)
   - Presentations (like this!)

3. **Truly Reproducible**
   - Re-run entire analysis with one click
   - Changes automatically propagate
   - Perfect for revisions
:::

# R Projects

## The Problem with Working Directories

::: {.callout-warning}
## Don't Do This ❌

```r
setwd("C:/Users/YourName/Documents/My Research/Project 1/Data")
data <- read.csv("survey.csv")
```

**Why this is bad:**

- Won't work on anyone else's computer
- Won't work when you move files
- Breaks reproducibility
- Makes collaboration impossible
:::

## R Projects to the Rescue ✅

**R Projects solve path problems**

When you open an `.Rproj` file:

::: {.incremental}
1. RStudio starts fresh R session
2. Working directory automatically set to project folder
3. Use relative paths that work anywhere:
   ```r
   data <- read_csv("data/survey.csv")
   ggsave("figures/plot1.png")
   ```
4. Project-specific settings saved
5. Easy to zip and share entire project
:::

## Creating an R Project

**Three common ways:**

::: {.panel-tabset}

### New Project
1. `File > New Project > New Directory`
2. Choose project type
3. Select location
4. Click "Create Project"

### Existing Folder
1. `File > New Project > Existing Directory`
2. Navigate to folder
3. Click "Create Project"

### From Git (Best!)
1. `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`
2. Paste repository URL
3. Choose location
4. Click "Create Project"

:::

## Organizing Your Project {.smaller}

**Recommended structure:**

```
my-project/
├── my-project.Rproj
├── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── scripts/
│   ├── 01-clean-data.R
│   └── 02-analyze.R
├── documents/
│   └── paper.qmd
├── figures/
└── output/
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tips
- Use meaningful names
- Number scripts in order
- Keep raw data separate (never edit!)
- Document everything in README
:::

# Version Control with Git

::: {.callout-note}
## Workshop Schedule Note
Today we're introducing Git/GitHub concepts and basic setup. We'll do a **deep dive into Git workflows** on **Day 2/3** of the workshop with hands-on practice and advanced techniques.
:::

## What is Version Control?

**Track every change to your project over time**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without version control:**

```
thesis_final.docx
thesis_final_v2.docx
thesis_final_FINAL.docx
thesis_final_FINAL_revised.docx
thesis_final_actual_final.docx
```

😱 Which one is current?  
😱 What changed between versions?  
😱 Who made what changes?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**With version control:**

```
thesis.docx
```

✅ Complete history saved  
✅ See all changes  
✅ Revert to any version  
✅ Multiple people can work  
✅ Track who did what
:::
:::

## Git Basics

**Git = Distributed Version Control System**

::: {.incremental}
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Works locally on your computer
- Creates "snapshots" (commits) of your project
- Lets you explore different versions
- Enables collaboration
- Industry standard for code projects
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Git is powerful but has a learning curve. We'll focus on essential operations.
:::

## GitHub vs. Git

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Git
- Version control software
- Runs on your computer
- Tracks file changes
- Command-line tool
- Works offline
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### GitHub
- Online platform
- Built on top of Git
- Cloud storage for repositories
- Web interface
- Collaboration features
- Social coding platform
:::
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Think of Git as your local diary, GitHub as publishing that diary online
:::

## Why Use Git for Research?

::: {.incremental}
1. **Never lose work**
   - Complete project history
   - Restore any previous version
   - Experiment safely

2. **Understand what changed**
   - See exact changes between versions
   - Trace when bugs introduced
   - Document decision process

3. **Collaborate effectively**
   - Multiple people work simultaneously
   - Merge contributions automatically
   - Clear attribution of work

4. **Publish and share**
   - Make research reproducible
   - Share code publicly
   - Get feedback and contributions
:::

# Getting Started with Git

## Initial Setup

**First time only:**

```bash
# Tell Git who you are
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Check settings
git config --list
```

::: {.callout-note}
Use the same email as your GitHub account!
:::

## Create Your First Repository

**On GitHub:**

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your repository (e.g., "test-project")
3. Choose public or private
4. ✅ Check "Add a README file"
5. Click "Create repository"

::: {.callout-important}
Initialize with README so repository isn't empty
:::

## Clone Repository to Your Computer

**In RStudio:**

1. `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`
2. Paste repository URL from GitHub
3. Choose where to save
4. Click "Create Project"

**You now have:**

- Local copy on your computer
- Connected to GitHub (remote)
- Ready to start working!

# The Git Workflow

::: {.callout-important}
## Today: Overview Only
We're covering Git fundamentals today. **Day 2/3 will include:**

- Detailed workflow demonstrations
- Hands-on practice with your projects
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Advanced collaboration techniques
- Branch management strategies

For now, focus on understanding the concepts!
:::

## Four Essential Operations

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### 1. Stage (Add)
Select which changes to save

### 2. Commit
Save staged changes with message

### 3. Pull
Download changes from GitHub

### 4. Push
Upload your commits to GitHub
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{mermaid}
graph TD
    A[Edit Files] --> B[Stage]
    B --> C[Commit]
    C --> D{Collaborating?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Pull First]
    D -->|No| F[Push]
    E --> F
    F --> A
```
:::
:::

## The Commit Cycle

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Step 1: Make Changes
Edit your files as normal

```r
# analysis.R
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("data/survey.csv")

# New analysis
model <- lm(outcome ~ treatment, data = data)
```

### Step 2: Stage
Click checkboxes next to changed files in Git pane

### Step 3: Commit
Click "Commit", write message:

```
Add linear regression analysis

- Import survey data
- Run treatment effect model
- TODO: Add control variables
```

### Step 4: Push
Click "Push" to sync with GitHub

:::

## Writing Good Commit Messages {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ❌ Bad Messages

```
update
fixed stuff
asdf
final version
changes
more changes
```

**Problems:**

- Not descriptive
- Future you won't understand
- Can't search history
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ✅ Good Messages

```
Add regression models for main analysis

Fix missing data handling in cleaning script

Update Figure 2 with reviewer comments

Remove deprecated ggplot2 syntax
```

**Why better:**

- Explains what changed
- Explains why (if needed)
- Searchable
- Professional
:::
:::

## RStudio Git Interface

**In the Git pane you can:**

::: {.incremental}
- 📋 See which files changed (Status column)
- ☑️ Stage/unstage files (checkboxes)
- 💬 Commit changes (Commit button)
- 📥 Pull from GitHub (Pull button)
- 📤 Push to GitHub (Push button)
- 🌿 Create/switch branches (branch dropdown)
- 📊 View history (History button)
- ⚙️ Advanced operations (gear menu)
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Keep the Git pane open while working
:::

# Important Git Concepts

## The Sacred Order

::: {.callout-warning}
## Always: Stage → Commit → Pull → Push

**Never skip the commit before pulling!**
:::

::: {.incremental}
1. **Stage** your changes
2. **Commit** with good message
3. **Pull** to get remote changes
4. **Push** your commits

**Why this order?**

- Pulling after committing preserves your work
- Git can merge changes intelligently
- If conflicts arise, you can resolve them
- Your work is never lost
:::

## Merge Conflicts

**What causes conflicts?**

Two people edit the same lines in the same file

**Example scenario:**

::: {.incremental}
1. You: Edit line 10 of `analysis.R`, commit
2. Collaborator: Edit line 10 of `analysis.R`, push to GitHub
3. You: Try to push → Conflict!
4. You: Pull → Git says "fix conflicts"
5. You: Open file, see conflict markers:
   ```r
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)  # Your version
   =======
   model <- glm(y ~ x1, data = data, family = binomial)  # Their version
   >>>>>>> abc123
   ```
6. You: Choose which to keep (or combine), save, commit, push
:::

## Handling Conflicts

::: {.panel-tabset}

### 1. Don't Panic
Conflicts are normal! They're just Git asking you to make a decision.

### 2. Open the File
Conflict markers show both versions:

```r
<<<<<<< HEAD
your_code()
=======
their_code()
>>>>>>> branch
```

### 3. Decide What to Keep
- Keep yours
- Keep theirs  
- Combine both
- Write something new

### 4. Remove Markers
Delete `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` lines

### 5. Stage, Commit, Push
:::

## Branches (Optional but Powerful)

**Branches let you work on features independently**

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   branch feature
   checkout feature
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   commit
   merge feature
   commit
```

::: {.incremental}
- `main` branch = stable version
- Create feature branch for experiments
- Work freely without breaking main
- Merge back when ready (or delete if failed)
:::

# Collaboration with GitHub

## Inviting Collaborators

**For private repositories:**

1. Go to repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Collaborators"
4. Click "Add people"
5. Enter their GitHub username
6. They'll receive invitation email

**For public repositories:**

- Anyone can see and fork
- Control who can directly push

## Collaborative Workflow

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good practices:**

✅ Communicate about who's working on what  
✅ Pull before starting work  
✅ Commit small, logical changes  
✅ Push regularly  
✅ Write clear commit messages  
✅ Review each other's code  
✅ Use branches for big changes  
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Avoid:**

❌ Both editing same file simultaneously  
❌ Committing large files (>100MB)  
❌ Waiting days between pushes  
❌ Vague commit messages  
❌ Pushing broken code to main  
❌ Force pushing (unless you know why)  
:::
:::

## Working Solo? Still Use Git!

**You're collaborating with future you**

::: {.incremental}
- Track your thought process
- Experiment without fear
- Document decisions in commits
- Build portfolio of work
- Practice good habits
- Publish your research code
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Start with private repos until comfortable, then make research public
:::

# Common Git Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Made Changes by Mistake

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Not Committed Yet
**Easy!** Right-click file in Git pane → Revert

### Already Committed, Not Pushed
```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Already Pushed
```bash
# Create new commit that undoes changes
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Nuclear Option
Just clone fresh copy of repo (loses local work!)

:::

## Scenario 2: Want to Try Something Risky

**Use a branch!**

1. Create new branch: `experimental-analysis`
2. Make changes, commit as usual
3. If it works → merge to main
4. If it fails → delete branch

**You preserved the working main branch**

## Scenario 3: Forgot to Pull Before Committing

::: {.incremental}
1. Don't panic
2. Try to pull anyway
3. Git will usually merge automatically
4. If conflicts → resolve them
5. Commit the merge
6. Push

**Lesson learned:** Pull → Commit → Push
:::

## Scenario 4: Accidentally Committed Sensitive Data

::: {.callout-danger}
## Sensitive Data Includes:
- Passwords
- API keys
- Personal information (emails, addresses)
- Confidential data
:::

**Prevention:**

- Use `.gitignore` file
- Never commit passwords (use environment variables)
- Keep sensitive data separate

**If you did commit:**

- Change passwords immediately!
- Rewrite Git history (advanced) or just make repo private

# Advanced Topics (Brief Overview)

## .gitignore File

**Tell Git to ignore certain files:**

```
# R files
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata

# Large data
data/raw/*.csv
data/raw/*.dta

# Outputs (regenerate from code)
figures/*.png
output/*.html

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Sensitive
config/passwords.txt
.env
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Every R project should have a `.gitignore` file
:::

## GitHub Features {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Issues**

- Track bugs
- Plan features
- Discuss ideas
- Assign tasks

**Pull Requests**

- Propose changes
- Code review
- Discussion
- Quality control
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Releases**

- Tag versions (v1.0, v2.0)
- Provide downloads
- Document changes

**GitHub Pages**

- Free website hosting
- Perfect for documentation
- Publish research websites
:::
:::

## Git with Large Files

::: {.callout-warning}
## GitHub Limits
- Individual files: 100 MB max
- Repository: 1 GB recommended max
:::

**Solutions:**

- Don't commit large data files
- Use data repositories (OSF, Dataverse)
- Download data via script
- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for essential large files
- Store processed/aggregated data instead of raw

## Command Line Git (Optional)

**RStudio GUI covers 90% of needs, but CLI is powerful:**

```bash
git status              # See what changed
git add file.R          # Stage a file
git commit -m "message" # Commit
git pull                # Pull from remote
git push                # Push to remote
git log                 # View history
git diff                # See changes
git branch new-feature  # Create branch
git checkout main       # Switch branch
```

::: {.callout-note}
Learn CLI gradually as you need advanced features
:::

# Putting It All Together

## Your Complete Workflow

::: {.incremental}
1. **Setup (once)**
   - Install R, RStudio, Git
   - Create GitHub account
   - Configure Git with your info

2. **Start Project**
   - Create repository on GitHub
   - Clone to create R Project
   - Set up directory structure
   - Create .gitignore

3. **Daily Work**
   - Open .Rproj file
   - Pull to sync
   - Write code, analyze data
   - Stage, commit regularly
   - Push at end of session

4. **Collaborate**
   - Invite team members
   - Communicate about tasks
   - Review each other's work
   - Resolve conflicts together

**Complete workflow preview:**

::: {.incremental}
1. Create new repository on GitHub called "r-practice"
2. Clone it and create R Project in RStudio
3. Create file `analysis.R` with simple code:
   ```r
   # My first R project
   x <- 1:10
   y <- x^2
   plot(x, y)
   ```
4. Stage, commit with message "Add first analysis"
5. Push to GitHub
6. Edit file, add: `print(summary(y))`
7. Commit with message "Add summary statistics"
8. Push again
9. View your commit history on GitHub!
