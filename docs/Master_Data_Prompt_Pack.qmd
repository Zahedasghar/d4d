# 1️⃣ Foundation Prompts — Starting Any Data Task

## 🔹 Prompt 1: Understand My Dataset
```
You are a data analysis expert. I will upload a dataset. 
Please examine its structure, variable types, missingness, and give me:
1. Summary of dataset  
2. Data quality issues  
3. Potential analytic directions  
4. Suggested plots and modeling steps  
5. Which variables look demographic and which look health/socioeconomic  
Use clear bullet points.
```

---

## 🔹 Prompt 2: Generate a Full EDA Plan
```
Create a complete EDA plan for a demographic/health dataset.
Include:
- Descriptive statistics 
- Missing data treatment options
- Outlier detection methods
- Grouped summaries (gender/age/income)
- Plots (histogram, boxplot, barplot, correlations)
- Survey-weight considerations (if applicable)
- Recommendations for modeling
Output in step-by-step format.
```

# 2️⃣ Prompts for NHANES Analysis

## 🔹 Prompt 3: NHANES Cleaning & Recoding
```
You are NHANES specialist.  
I want to clean NHANES data and prepare it for analysis.  
Give me R code for:
- Recoding demographics (age groups, BMI categories, race)
- Creating comorbidity indicators (hypertension, diabetes, obesity)
- Handling missing survey weights
- Preparing survey design object (svydesign)
```

## 🔹 Prompt 4: NHANES Risk Factor Index
```
Using NHANES variables, generate an R script to create a composite 
health risk index (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, inactivity, smoking).  
Include:
- Binary indicators  
- Row-sum risk score  
- Distribution summary  
- Visualization  
```

---

# 3️⃣ Prompts for Demographic Survey Data (DHS/Custom Surveys)

## 🔹 Prompt 5: Survey EDA + Weighting
```
You are a survey data modeling expert.
I have a DHS-style demographic dataset.  
Create R code to:
- Apply sample weights  
- Produce weighted frequencies and cross-tabs  
- Generate fertility, mortality, and household indicators  
- Visualize distributions  
- Summarize key demographic trends  
```

## 🔹 Prompt 6: Complex Survey Modeling
```
Help me build survey-weighted regression models using R's survey package.
Provide:
- Logistic model example  
- Poisson/negative binomial example  
- Guidance on interpretation  
- Goodness-of-fit diagnostics  
- How to use strata and PSU variables  
```

---

# 4️⃣ Prompts for World-in-Data + Global Datasets

## 🔹 Prompt 7: Country-Level EDA (World in Data)
```
I want to analyze country-level demographic indicators using World in Data.
Generate an R workflow that:
- Downloads selected indicators (fertility, GDP per capita, life expectancy)  
- Merges them  
- Cleans and creates harmonized country-year panel  
- Performs EDA, trends, and comparative analysis  
- Highlights Pakistan vs regional peers  
```

## 🔹 Prompt 8: Cross-Country Modeling
```
Develop a cross-country demographic model using:
- fertility rate
- GDP per capita
- female education
- urbanization
- health spending
Provide R code for:
- Panel regression setup  
- Fixed vs random effects choice  
- Diagnostics  
- Interpretation in simple language  
```

---

# 5️⃣ Prompts for Choropleth Maps (R)

## 🔹 Prompt 9: Choropleth Map Creation
```
Act as a mapping expert in R. 
Generate code to:
- Load shapefiles (Pakistan districts or any country map)
- Merge demographic indicators with spatial data
- Create choropleth maps using tmap / ggplot2
- Add titles, legends, and color scales
- Produce high-resolution exportable maps
```

## 🔹 Prompt 10: Comparative Spatial Patterns
```
Create a side-by-side spatial comparison map for two demographic variables:
example: literacy rate vs child mortality.
Provide R code for:
- Data merge  
- Two-panel tmap layout  
- Summary interpretation for policymakers  
```

---

# 6️⃣ Prompts for Full AI-Driven Analysis Workflows

## 🔹 Prompt 11: End-to-End AI-Guided Data Analysis
```
You are my AI data analyst.  
Given this dataset, produce a full workflow:
1. Understand dataset  
2. Clean & preprocess  
3. EDA visualizations  
4. Feature engineering  
5. Regression/classification/clustering  
6. Model interpretation  
7. Policy-relevant narrative  
Generate R code and explanations.
```

---

## 🔹 Prompt 12: “Vibe Coding” — Improve Diagnostics
```
Review my R code and “vibe it up.”  
Improve:
- efficiency  
- readability  
- narrative labeling  
- interpretability  
- comments for students  

Suggest alternative plots and better coding style.
```

---

## 🔹 Prompt 13: AI-Generated Storytelling for Data
```
Based on my dataset summary, write a short, simple, policy-friendly 
story that explains the demographic trends and their implications.
Tone: accessible, non-technical.
```
